Because i'm too lazy to read.

## Installing the unpackaged extension directly (not via chrome store)
In Google Chrome:
- Visit chrome://extensions/
- Enable developer mode
- Load unpacked extension
- Select the directory for the extension
- Make sure it's enabled (should be by default)
- Reload any tabs open already

## Usage
- Highlight some text
- Click extension
- Continue to do whatever you were doing before and have the browser read something to you at the same time
